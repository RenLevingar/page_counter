# page_counter
Description - This is a page view counter to count how many times the page has been viewed and rendered. 

Utilization - This can be run by running the rest of your react app and will take effec on load.

Implementation - This should be the last thing implemented in every render as it is coded to appear at the bottom of a page.

Color - To change the color go to the app.css, it is the color listed under the "counter" class.

UseStrict - Make sure that the app doesn't render into a "UseStrict" react tag or else the counter will increment twice each time.

Hooks - Both useEffect and useState were used and imported into the component.

Leaving the Page - Even if the page is left the number will remain the same as it uses the browsers local storage instead of session storage.
